Summary of Project:
Due to recent unfortunate airline crashes, the media has been promoting statistics stating air is no longer a safe way to travel. The news and media outlets have been bombarding the public with reports and figures about the downward trends of airline safety.  
What was previously thought as the safest way to travel, especially when compared to road travel, is now being presented as one of the most dangerous to the public. But are any of these claims based on facts? 
This project looks to prove that airline travel is still the safest way to travel by visualizing airline safety statistics in a variety of ways (visualizations, website, infographic, etc.)
